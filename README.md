# Prototype of a ThreadManager in C++
### 1. Description
This project focus on threads, and provide a simple way to manage thread without knowing about mutex and staff like that. It is not finished and doesn't work properly in some situations. I am learning ðŸ˜¢
### 2. Display
Despite the fact that this is a terminal program without any graphical user interface, a lot of message logs will be printed, for now there is no way to select a silent mode, but it will be implemented.

### 3. THANKS
Thank you for read this, I don't have any work experience so maybe my codes use quiet deprecated techniques etc. Anything you wanna know or comment about the code use the information in contact section in my github profile.

Have a nice day! ðŸ¤“
